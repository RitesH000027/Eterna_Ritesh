# Railway Simple Demo Deployment

## Quick Deploy Instructions

Since the full TypeScript application has some dependency conflicts in the cloud environment, here's how to deploy just the working demo:

### Option 1: Vercel (Serverless)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy demo server
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (Static)
The demo.html can be served directly from GitHub Pages:
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Enable GitHub Pages
3. Demo will be available at: https://ritesh000027.github.io/Eterna_Ritesh/examples/demo.html

### Option 3: Glitch (Simple)
1. Import from GitHub: https://github.com/RitesH000027/Eterna_Ritesh
2. Glitch will automatically detect and run the Node.js server
